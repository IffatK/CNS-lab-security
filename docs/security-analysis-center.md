# Malware & Website Security Analysis Center

## Setup

Install Python requirements (ReportLab is used for PDF export). On Ubuntu, local malware scanning also needs an updated ClamAV installation:

```bash
sudo apt install clamav clamav-freshclam
sudo freshclam
sudo systemctl enable --now clamav-freshclam
```

If `clamav-freshclam` is already updating signatures, do not start a second updater. The app marks a scan incomplete if ClamAV is missing, unavailable, times out, or cannot finish; it never converts those outcomes to clean.

The following settings are optional:

- `SECURITY_SCAN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30` bounds malware subprocess time and is checked between network operations. Network operations use short socket timeouts and byte/redirect limits; a system DNS resolver call cannot be interrupted, so the total network-scan deadline is best effort.
- `GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY` enables URL reputation checks. The user must opt in for each URL scan; the URL is then disclosed to Google Safe Browsing.
- `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` enables file-hash reputation lookups. The user must opt in for each file scan; only its SHA-256 hash is sent, never the file bytes.

Do not commit real provider credentials. Missing keys do not prevent startup or local scanning.

## Scope and behavior

The analysis center stores scans and findings in the application database. A small in-process executor runs at most two scans concurrently and allows up to four queued/running jobs. A process restart marks unfinished jobs failed so they do not appear to run forever. This is suitable for the bounded educational workload; a multi-worker production deployment should replace it with a durable queue.

URL and website fetches permit HTTP/HTTPS on ports 80/443 only, resolve and validate all addresses as globally routable, connect to a validated address directly, and revalidate every redirect. Redirects stay on the submitted hostname; a new hostname requires a separate explicitly authorized scan. Quick Website Scan requests only the submitted origin (plus same-host redirects); Comprehensive Scan adds five fixed same-host GET checks (`/.env`, `/.git/HEAD`, `/server-status`, `/actuator/env`, `/admin/`). Neither mode crawls, executes JavaScript, authenticates, brute-forces, or sends exploit payloads. Response bytes are capped, cookies are never persisted, and only cookie names/flag gaps may appear in findings. TLS findings rely on normal trust-chain and hostname verification; failed TLS validation is not treated as healthy. Legacy TLS protocol negotiation is not actively probed.

Remote unauthenticated scans cannot reliably verify XSS, SQL injection, IDOR/broken access control, authenticated CSRF/session weaknesses, path traversal, upload authorization, or application-specific SSRF behavior. These are explicitly listed as not assessed in the persisted report; the scanner does not run active exploit payloads. Source-map references are observed only in the bounded response body; referenced files are not fetched. DNS resolver stalls cannot be interrupted by the best-effort total deadline.

The rating is a transparent worst-finding rubric, not CVSS: Critical=100, High=75, Medium=50, Low=25, Informational=0; the highest severity weight is the overall score. Confidence is separate and does not modify severity. No findings and a clean ClamAV result are not guarantees of safety.

Reports are generated from persisted scan records. History, detail, JSON, CSV, and PDF access are restricted to the scan owner. Exports are audit-logged. CSV output neutralizes spreadsheet formula prefixes. The scanner does not store uploaded bytes after a scan. Existing `security_findings` tables receive additive remediation/verification-step columns at startup after the standard instance backup.

## API contract

- `POST /security-center/scan/website` accepts `url`, required `authorized=on`, and optional `scan_mode=quick|comprehensive`; returns `202` with the persisted scan ID and status.
- `POST /security-center/scan/url` accepts `url` and optional per-scan `share_reputation=on` consent.
- `POST /security-center/scan/file` accepts multipart `file` and optional `share_file_hash=on` consent.
- `GET /security-center/api/scans/<id>` returns the owner-scoped persisted status, progress, risk, and result links.
- `POST /security-center/api/scans/<id>/cancel` requests cancellation (CSRF required).
- `GET /security-center/<id>` displays persisted findings and recommendations; `/report.json`, `/report.csv`, and `/report.pdf` export the same owner-scoped scan record.

Mutating routes require authentication and CSRF validation. The background executor accepts a maximum of four queued/running jobs globally and runs two concurrently.

## Migrations and tests

`db.create_all()` creates the additive `security_scans` and `security_findings` tables on startup. Existing user, message, and file rows are not modified. Tests should mock DNS/HTTP/reputation services or use isolated fixtures; never use an unauthorized public target.
